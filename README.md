## 1. Abstract

This paper presents the design and implementation of SmartCrawler, a compact, tri-legged robotic system developed for autonomous navigation and inspection of pipelines with varying internal diameters. Each leg of the robot features a dual-wheel configuration and an expansion-contraction mechanism actuated by a lead screw assembly, enabling adaptive adjustment to pipeline dimensions. A pressure-based sensing approach is employed to detect contact with pipe walls, allowing SmartCrawler to dynamically regulate its structural span and maintain stable locomotion. The robot is capable of negotiating both straight and curved sections of the pipeline while preserving traction and orientation. A mathematical model is developed to analyze the kinematics, motion control, and energy-efficient behavior of the system under constrained conditions. The robot is built using lightweight, 3D-printed components and tested through integrated simulation and real-world trials. SmartCrawler demonstrates potential as an effective, autonomous solution for pipeline inspection, with applicability in industrial maintenance and hazardous environment exploration.
